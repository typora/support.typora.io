# Activation

## Pre-conditions and Important Notes

To activate Typora, you will need to [purchase a license](https://store.typora.io/) first. After your purchase a license code will be sent to your email address, which you can use to activate Typora.

Please note that Typora allow you to **use one email to purchase Typora while activated it another email address**. Once you have used a license code, you will need to use the **same email address** for future activations, so please make sure that you have entered a valid email address.

Activation **requires internet connection**, so you will need access to [store.typora.io](https://store.typora.io) to proceed with activation.

Activating Typora activates your account's copy of Typora on your current machine. If you switch to other accounts or other devices, you will need to activate Typora for those new accounts or devices. One license code can be used to activate a maximum of 3 devices at a time, and different accounts and operating systems on one machine are considered separate devices.

## Register / Activate Typora

You can activate Typora in the `License Panel`. On macOS, you can open the `License Panel` from the menu bar: `Typora` → `My license…`. On Windows / Linux, you can open the `License panel` from the menu bar: `Help` → `My license…`.

Afterwards, Typora will be up and running!

## Offline Activation

It requires Typora ≥ 1.1.0-dev.

<img src="/media/activation/Screen Shot 2022-02-02 at 20.43.53.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-02 at 20.43.53" style="zoom:50%;" />

Once you generated an `Activation Token`, that will occupy one available seats for the license (one license has up to 3 activated devices at one time) for at least 6 month, because we cannot know if you are using that device or not since it is offline.

In other words, **devices that is activated by offline activation cannot be deactivated in at least 6 month**, and will be counted in the 3 devices limit for one license code, unless it was back to internet again.

If you want to use offline activation, [please see details here](/Offline-Activation).

If those two entries are not the same this error will be displayed, so please check if you have entered your email address correctly.

### Error message "This license code has been used with a different email address."

After using a license code, **the same email address** MUST be used for the same license code in future activations.  This error appears if the email address you use is not the same email address that was used when activating Typora with the license code for the first time.

### Error message "Failed to access the license server. Please check your network or try again later."

Typora activation requires a network connection, so:

- (**For Chinese User**) 如果您是中国国内用户，请打开 偏好设置 → 通用 → Typora 服务使用国内服务器，如果看不到该选项，请更新或（从官网重新）下载最新版本。

- Please check your **network** connection, especially check if you can access [store.typora.io](https://store.typora.io).

- Check for **firewalls** that may block Typora's access to the Internet or local disk. You can also try disable your firewall and run Typora in Administer mode.

- Or, you could try [offline activation](/Offline-Activation/) with Typora ≥ [1.1.0 dev](https://typora.io/releases/dev).

## My Typora has been unexpectedly deactivated.

If you have activated Typora but find that it has been unexpectedly disabled, usually the reason may be:

- That you have activated Typora on a fourth device, since a license code can be used on at most 3 devices at a time. Therefore, if you have activated Typora on a fourth device, the oldest device will be deactivated automatically. You can deactivate Typora on the devices you no longer need and then re-activate Typora on these devices, or you must purchase more license codes if you want to use Typora on more than 3 devices.
- If you switch to new accounts on the same computer, you will need to activate Typora for this user. One license code can be used to activate a maximum of 3 devices at a time. Different accounts on one machine are counted as separate devices.

## How many devices can I use at the same time for one license?

A maximum of 3 devices. Devices means different devices, different operating systems and VMs on a device, different accounts on an operating system...

## What if I have more than 3 devices?

If you want to activate more than 3 devices **at the same time**, you will need to purchase more license codes. 

If you have switched from old to new devices, you can [deactivate typora](#deactivate-typora) on old / unused devices.

## What is allowed or not allowed when using Typora?

Please refer to our [End User License Agreement](https://support.typora.io/License-Agreement/).

## I have other questions...

Please contact <hi@typora.io>. If your question is about activation and orders, please attach information such as the email address used for purchase, the license code you used for activation, etc.
