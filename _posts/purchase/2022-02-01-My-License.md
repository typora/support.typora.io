If you want to retrieve license code from email address you used to activate Typora, you can open <https://store.typora.io/my> and fill your email address.

Then, please check the email sent from us and click "My License" button to open the license management page.

In above page,

`1` shows your license code. 

`2` shows details of your activated devices.

`3` allows to deactivate Typora on that machine when it is not accessible.

By clicking `4`, you will lead to a page to see your order details and invoice (You will need to input email address again in case your license code was originally purchased by others).

If you have questions about the orders, please fill the form after clicking `5`.

Please notice that also "used" license will be shown in this page, if you purchased without activating it, please check your mail box or goes to <https://typora.onfastspring.com/account> instead.
