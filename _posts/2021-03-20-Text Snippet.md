Typora currently does not support text snippets, you may refer to system built-in, or 3rd app solution for this.

## MacOS

### Use System Preferences for text shortcut

You can open System Preferences → Keyboard → Text to set text replacement:

<img src="/media/macOS/Screen Shot 2020-12-07 at 00.06.06.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-07 at 00.06.06" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Insert Date and Time

You can use [wordservice](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordservice/id899972312?mt=12) to insert date, time, or file path.
