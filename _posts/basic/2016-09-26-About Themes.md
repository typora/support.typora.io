## Change Themes

Typora has 6 built-in themes, which can be selected using under the **Themes menu** in the menu bar. You can also download, install, modify, or write your own custom theme to stylize Typora.

Typora uses CSS to style everything. Each theme shown in the Themes menu is one `.css` file under "Typora's theme folder". So you can add/modify themes by adding/modifying corresponding `.css` files under "Typora's theme folder".

## Use Themes Under Light Mode and Dark Mode

You can set separate themes for light mode and dark mode (on macOS / Windows). When the system’s color scheme changes, the corresponding theme you chose will be applied.

Your theme can also use media query for [prefers color scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) to write a responsive theme for both light mode and dark mode.

## Naming Rule

When writing your own theme, you need to use this file naming rule for theme CSS: do not use capitalized letters, and nonalphabet characters except `-`. Replace any whitespace with `-`, and Typora will convert them to a readable label in its menu item. For example, for `my-first-typora-theme.css`, Typora will show “My First Typora Theme” under the “Themes” menu.

## Get Typora Themes

We have an official website [Typora Theme Gallery](http://theme.typora.io) for designers/developers to share their custom themes with others. You can download themes from there.

## Modify Current Styles

Sometimes you may just want to change the font family for all themes or change the font color for headings for specific themes. In this case, you do not need to copy/modify an existing `.css` file, instead [Add Custom CSS](/Add-Custom-CSS/) is enough.

## Writing My Own Theme

Please see [Write Custom Theme for Typora](http://theme.typora.io/doc/Write-Custom-Theme/).

## Debug Theme CSS

You can open Chrome/Safari DevTools to debug element styles.

- On macOS, you could check `Help` -> `Enable Debug` menu item, then right-click anywhere in Typora's hybrid edit view, then click "Inspect Elements" from the context menu.
- On Windows/Linux, you could open DevTools from `View` -> `Toggle DevTools` menu item.
