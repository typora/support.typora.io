# New / Improvement

### File Link

Typora already supports link to local file or folder, like `[text](./filename.md)`, in this update:

- If file link target (like `filename.md`) does not exists, Typora allows you to create that file or folder with simple click.

- If you add anchor after the target file path (like `filename.md#header-1`), you can open that file and directly jump to the anchor position by open that link. About how to get the `#` anchor, you can follow [internal links](/Links/#internal-links) about how to write an anchor.

### Math

- We added an option to enable or disable [`physics`](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/physics) package, which will replace the old "*When enabled, commands like \\div, \\Re will be redefined by physics package*" option. Following are example:

  | `physics` package enabled                                    | `physics` package disabled                                   |

- Fix an issue that math numbering will get wrong when opening file in some cases.

- Fix `Copy as MathML` for math block not working properly. One tip is that you can select `Copy as MathML` in Typora's math block, and then select `Paste` → `Keep Text Only` in Word to paste math contents.

### Editing

- `Copy` will do nothing when no text is selected (previously, it will put empty string to clipboard). 

- We also add options to `copy` / `cut` the whole line which that have cursors on them, if there is no selection, which you can find similar behavior in most code editors or IDEs, like VS Code, etc.

  <img src="/media/new-1.1/Screen Shot 2022-02-04 at 22.06.00.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-04 at 22.06.00" style="zoom:50%;" />

- On macOS, you can now also use Command-Option-Shift-V to paste as Markdown source (same behavior with Command-Shift-V), just like other editors' *Paste and Match Style* behavior.

### UI / I18N

- Fix some typos.
- Update translations in many languages, including Korean, Catalan, Turkish, Polish, Hungarian, Japanese, Indonesian, Dutch, etc.
- Add Malay language support (Thanks to [MLukman](https://github.com/MLukman)).
- Add Slovenian language support (Thanks to [sponka9](https://github.com/sponka9)).
- Update some UI icons and use more compact context menu for Windows / Linux.

### Security

- Windows executables and installers are now signed.
- Fix an XSS security issue.

### Images

- Typora now will ensure proper file extensions be added when download and save web images to local.

- You could now append hash tag after local image path, for example: `![img](image.png#center)`. Typora is now able to load them ignoring trailing hashes. 

  One tip is that hashes on image URLs are a very convenient way of providing a CSS styling styling hook, like:

  ```css
  img[href&='#center`] {
  	margin: auto
  }
  ```

### Image Export

- Fix custom font size not working for image export.
- Add option to use default / theme font size when export as image.
- Fix image corrupted if your Typora is zoomed.

### Command Line

- On macOS, if you add

  ```shell
  alias typora="/Applications/Typora.app/Contents/MacOS/Typora"
  ```

  in your `.bash_profile` or other configuration file, Typora will pop up dialog to let you create file or folder when target file (in passed parameters)  does not exists.

- On Windows / Linux, if you run `typora test.md` and `test.md` does not exist, then Typora will not popup error dialog. The file will be created when save without extra confirmation, just like other editors.

### License / Activation

- You could now manage your activated license and deactivate devices via web page <https://store.typora.io/my>. You could find more details at [here](/My-License/).

- Offline activation is now supported. You could find more details at [here](/Offline-Activation/).
