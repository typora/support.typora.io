## OS X and macOS (Typora ≥ 0.9.9.8.2)

On OS X and macOS, the operating system will schedule an auto-save for document-based apps such as Typora and TextEdit. So `auto-save` is always enabled as a system feature.

1. If you want Typora to auto-save content when quitting the app or closing a file without popping up a confirm dialog, please **uncheck** checkbox ⓵.
2. If you want Typora to restore all windows/documents when restart, please **uncheck** checkbox ⓶.

## Windows/Linux (Typora ≥ 0.9.21)

You can enable this feature in the **Preferences panel**.

By default, the documents will be saved every 5 minutes. If you want to change the time interval, please click the `Open Advanced Settings` button in the Preferences panel. This would pop-up a directory named `conf`. Edit or create a file named `conf.user.json`, and modify or add following setting:

```json
{
  "autoSaveTimer": 5 // Double, default is 5. The unit is "minute"
}
```

### Recover Unsaved Drafts (Windows/Linux)

No matter whether the auto-save option is enabled or not, if Typora exits or crashes without saving the file, or you accidentally quite Typora without saving your work, you can click the `Recover Unsaved Drafts` button to access any writing drafts auto-saved by Typora.

The file name of backed-up drafts takes the form of `{date}-{filename}.md`. If your content is newly-created and therefore without a file path (i.e. _Untitled_), the `{filename}` part is auto-generated using the first heading or sentence. Copy the corresponding backup file to retrieve at least part of the content.
