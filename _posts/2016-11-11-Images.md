## Images in Markdown

The Markdown image tag is **![alt](src)**. The `src` can either be a URL, such as `https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png`, or a relative or absolute file path, for example `../images/test.png`.

## How To Insert Images In Typora

### Write the Markdown

You could simply write the Markdown syntax to insert an image. Otherwise, click **Format** **→**Image** from the menu bar, or press a shortcut key if you have set one. When you do this, if there is an image URL in clipboard, the URL will be inserted into the `src` part directly.

### Drag and Drop

Of course, there's a easier way — drag and drop, as shown in the screencast below. 

![drag-img](/media/about-image/drag-img.gif)

You can drag and drop multiple image files at one time.

### Select from local files

You can click the menu item **Edit** → **Image Tools** → **Insert Local Images…** on the menu bar. This opens a dialog where you can select and insert local image(s). If you use this menu item frequently, you can assign a shortcut key for the **insert image** command. This is explained in detail in [Custom Key Binding](http://support.typora.io/Custom-Key-Binding/).

### Paste images from the clipboard

Since a Markdown file contains only plain text, you cannot insert image data directly into a Markdown file. Instead, you must insert a reference to the file or a URL of an image. 

Typora supports pasting image data from the Clipboard, but you must indicate where that image is to be stored. Typora stores the image file in a folder on your computer or on or server, then inserts images referenced by that stored file or URL. Please refer to **[When to insert a local image…](#when-insert-local-image…)** for more detail.

#### OS X - macOS tips

> **1**: **You can copy the image file from the Finder** and paste it into Typora. This is the same behavior as with drag and drop.
>
> **2**: **You also can copy images from an iPhone** and then paste them into Typora after first setting the location to store image files.

## When To Insert A Local Image...

Typora supports copying image files into a given folder on your computer or on web server (this requires [iPic][]). When insert local images using drag and drop or from the menu bar, you must first set the location:

### Default behaviors

By default, when you insert or drag & drop a image file into Typora, it uses the path of image file for the `src` attribute. 

### Use A Relative Path

If you enable **Editor** → **Image Insert** →  **Use relative path if possible** in the Preferences panel, and your writing has been saved into a file, then when you drag and drop a local image, the `src` attribute will be set as its relative path to current file or folder.

### Copy Images to the Target Folder When Inserting Local Images

> **Note:** To use this feature, you must allow the option `Allow copy images to given folder` in the Preferences panel.

A common scenario is to edit `*.md` posts in static sites such as Jekyll using Typora. For example, if the `.*md` file is stored in the `_posts` folder while the image files go into the `_media` folder, you may want to copy images files into the `_media` folder if you drag and drop or paste images into the Markdown file automatically. Here's how to do this:

1. Save your file into some location.

2. Enable**`Editor** → **Image Insert** → **Allow copy images to given folder** in the Preferences panel.

   ![Snip20161117_2](/media/about-image/Snip20161117_2.png)

3. Select `Edit` → `Image Tools` → `When Insert Local Images` → `Copy Image File to Folder` from menubar, pick the target folder.

   ![Snip20161117_6](/media/about-image/Snip20161117_6.png)

In Step 3 (above), a new item `typora-copy-images-to: {relative path}` will be inserted into the [YAML Front Matter][] block of the current document. You could also manually add the **typora-copy-images-to** property in YAML Front Matter to enable this behaviour.

After that, if you drag and drop **local** images or paste images into Typora, the image file will be copied into the target file and the related `src` will be updated.

### Upload image file to web server (OS X / macOS only)

> **Requirements**: OS X/macOS ≥ 10.10 and [iPic][] must be installed. Also, you must enable `Allow upload to given server` in the Preferences panel.
>
> **Warning**: By default, _iPic_ will upload images to a public web server anonym them. You must configure _iPic_ in advance if you want to enable this feature and keep control of all the image files you upload.

Here's how to enable this function:

1. Install [iPic][] and **configure** a suitable online image service.
2. Enable **Editor** → **Image Insert** → **Allow copy images to given folder** in the Preferences panel.
3. Check item **Edit** → **Image Tools** → **When Insert Local Images** → **Upload Image via iPic** from the menu bar.

In step 3, a new item `typora-copy-images-to: ipic` will be inserted into the [YAML Front Matter][] block of the current document. You can also manually add the `typora-copy-images-to: ipic` property in YAML Front Matter to enable this behaviour.

>  **Tip:** If you want to store all image files in the `ipic` folder, you should use `typora-copy-images-to: ./ipic`.

## Display Images Using A Relative Path

### Relative Path To the Current file/folder (default)

By default, you can refer to local images by their paths relative to the current `*.md` file. For example, if the `*.md` file is at `/User/typora/desktop/test.md`, the `![img](image.png)` will display the image from `/User/typora/desktop/image.png` the same as with the `<img>` tag in HTML.

Images from `/User/typora/download/image.png` can be fetched with `../download/image.png`.

### Relative Path to A Folder

If you’re using Markdown for building web sites, you may specify a URL prefix for image preview on the local computer by using property `typora-root-url` in the YAML Front Matter. 

For example, if you add `typora-root-url:/User/Abner/Website/typora.io/` to YAML Front Matter, then:  `![alt](/blog/img/test.png)` will be treated as:  
`![alt](file:///User/Abner/Website/typora.io/blog/img/test.png)` by Typora.

In newer versions of Typora, instead of manually adding the `typora-root-url` property, you can click on **Edit** → **Image Tools** → **Use Image Root Path** on the menu bar to tell Typora to generate the `typora-root-url` property automatically.

## Upload images to cloud server (OS X-macOS only)

### Introduction To iPic

![ipic](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7322/28018346695_f1461c7a09_o.jpg)

[iPic][] is an app that allows you to upload local images into various cloud services, including  [Imgur](http://imgur.com/), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/),[ Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and others It returns a web URL of the uploaded images that you can use for public access. You can find detailed documentation [here](http://toolinbox.net/en/iPic/).

With the integration of [iPic][], users can share Markdown files with others without packaging local images along with the plain text file. -- and stop caring about where to put local images or how to refer to local images using a relative paths, since the images are all on a cloud server.

### System requirements and preparation

1. This feature only supports OS X - macOS ≥ 10.10.
2. You must install the latest version of [iPic][].
3. You must configure the web server in [iPic][].

### Upload All Local Images To A Cloud Server

Typora provides a function to upload all local images to a cloud server via [iPic][]. To use it, check **Edit** → `**Image Tools** → **Upload Local Images via iPic** from the menu bar and wait for the uploading process to be finished.

### Upload When Inserting Images

Instructions can be found in [When insert local image…](#when-insert-local-image…) → **Upload image file to web server**. (OS X - macOS only).

## Align Images

Currently Typora does not support image alignment, but you could use the HTML code `<center>![img](src)</center>` to align images in exported HTML or PDF files.

Also, by default, if a paragraph only contains one image, it will be center-aligned. This is controlled by the CSS, and can be changed by [adding custom CSS](http://support.typora.io/Add-Custom-CSS/):

```css
p .md-image:only-child{
    width: auto;
    text-align: inherit;
}
```
