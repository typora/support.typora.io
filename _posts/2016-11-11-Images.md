## Images in Markdown

> If a crash occurs while uploading images via iPic, please **re-download Typora from typora.io**.
>
> Requires latest version of Typora.

In markdown, images are written like `![alt](src)`. Where `src` can either be a URL such as  `https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png`, or an absolute/relative file path, like `../images/test.png`.

## How to insert images in Typora

### Drag & Drop

One of the easiest ways to insert images into Typora is to simply drag & drop the image you want to use from a file browser / explorer. Check out the animation below for an example.

![drag-img](/media/about-image/drag-img.gif)

It is also possible to drag & drop multiple image files at one time.

### Insert the Markdown syntax as text

To insert images from text sources simply type or paste in the markdown syntax to insert an image. Alternatively click "image" from the menu bar or press the shortcut key. Provided there is an image URL in the clipboard, then the URL will be inserted into the `src` part automatically.

### Select from local files

Select `Edit` → `Image Tools` → `Insert Local Images…` from the menu bar to open a dialog from which you can select and insert local image(s). 

If you use this menu item frequently, it may be a good idea to re-assign the shortcut key for the "insert image" command following the instructions at [Custom Key Binding](http://support.typora.io/Custom-Key-Binding/).

### Paste images from clipboard

Since Markdown files are only plain text, it is not possible to insert images directly into Markdown files, so a text reference to the file/URL is used instead.

Typora supports pasting image data from the clipboard, **although you must specify a folder/directory where Typora will save those images to**. Typora will save image data into the given folder or server, then insert image references to that stored file or URL. Please refer to the section **[Inserting local images](#Inserting-local-images)** for more details.

> **Tips**:  macOS users can copy image files from the finder and then paste into Typora. this provides the same behavior as drag and drop.
>
> **Tips**:  macOS users can also copy images from an iPhone and paste the image into Typora after setting up the location to save image files.

## Inserting local images

Typora supports copying image files into a given folder or web server (requires [iPic][]) when inserting local images using drag & drop or from the menu bar.
Follow the instructions below for setup.

### Default behavior

By default, Typora uses the path supplied by the attribute `src`  when inserting or dragging & dropping an image file into Typora.

### Using Relative Paths

If `Editor` → `Image Insert` →  `Use relative path if possible` is enabled in the preferences panel and your text has been saved to file, the `src` attribute will be set with its relative path as the current file (folder) when dragging & dropping a local image.

### Copying image files to target folder when insert local images

> To use this feature, you need to enable the option `Allow copy images to given folder` in preferences menu.

One common usage of Typora is editing `*.md` posts in static sites (like Jekyll). For example, if the `.*md` file is saved into the `_posts` folder and image files are saved in the `_media` folder, you may want to copy images files into the `_media` folder when you dragging/dropping or pasting images into Markdown files automatically. Here's how:

1. Save your file into a folder

2. Enable `Editor` → `Image Insert` → `Allow copy images to given folder` in preferences panel.

   <img src="/media/about-image/Snip20161117_2.png" style="zoom:50%" />

3. Select `Format` → `Image` → `When Insert Local Images` → `Copy Image File to Folder` from the menu bar and pick the target folder.

   ![Snip20161117_6](/media/about-image/Snip20161117_6.png)

In step 3, a new item `typora-copy-images-to: {relative path}` will be inserted into the [YAML Front Matter][] block of the current document. So you could also manually add the **typora-copy-images-to** property in YAML Front Matter to enable this behavior.

After that, if you drag & drop **local** images or paste images into Typora, the image file will be copied into the target file and update the relevant `src` attribute.

### Upload image file to web server. (macOS only)

> **Requirements**: macOS ≥ 10.10 and [iPic][] to be installed. Also, you need to enable `Allow upload to given server` in the preferences menu.
>
> **Warning**: By default, iPic will upload images to a public web server anonymously, and you won't be able to delete image files from that web server once you upload into it. Please configure iPic in advance if you want to enable this feature and control all the image files you have uploaded.

Here's how to enable this function:

1. Install [iPic][] and **config** a proper online image service.
2. Enable `Editor` → `Image Insert` → `Allow copy images to given folder` in preferences panel.
3. Check `Edit` → `Image Tools` → `When Insert Local Images` → `Upload Image via iPic` from the menu bar.

In step 3, a new item `typora-copy-images-to: ipic` will be inserted into the [YAML Front Matter][] block of the current document. 

It is also possible to manually add the **typora-copy-images-to: ipic** property in YAML Front Matter to enable this behavior.

Tips: If you want to move image file to folder `ipic`, you should use `typora-copy-images-to: ./ipic`.

### Use global setting for image insert operations.

It is possible to specify global settings for where to copy or upload images from, this can be changed in the image section of the preferences menu.

## Display images in relative path

### Relative path to current file/folder (default behavior)

By default, users can refer to a local image by its relative path to current `*.md` file. For example, if the `*.md` file is at `/User/typora/desktop/test.md`, then the `![img](image.png)` will display image from `/User/typora/desktop/image.png` just like the `<img>` tag in HTML.
Also, for `../download/image.png`, the image stored at `/User/typora/download/image.png` will be fetched.

### Relative path to certain folder

If you’re using markdown for building websites, you may specify a URL prefix for image previews in a local computer with the property `typora-root-url` in YAML Front Matters. 

For example, input `typora-root-url:/User/Abner/Website/typora.io/` in YAML Front Matters, and then `![alt](/blog/img/test.png)` will be treated as `![alt](file:///User/Abner/Website/typora.io/blog/img/test.png)` in typora.

In new version, instead of manually input `typora-root-url` property, you could just click item from the menu bar `Edit` → `Image Tools` → `Use Image Root Path` to tell Typora to generate `typora-root-url` property automatically.

## Upload images to cloud server (macOS only)

### Introduction to iPic

![ipic](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7322/28018346695_f1461c7a09_o.jpg)

[iPic][] is an app which allows you to upload local images into various cloud service, including  [Imgur](http://imgur.com/), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/),[ Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), etc, and return you a web URL of the uploaded image for public access. You could find detailed documents [here](http://toolinbox.net/en/iPic/).

With the integration of [iPic][], users could share markdown file to others without packaging local images along with the plain text file. And users can stop caring about where to put local images or how to refer local images using relative path, since they can simply upload used images into cloud server.

### System requirements and preparation

1. This feature only supports macOS ≥ 10.10.
2. Latest version of [iPic][] must be installed.
3. Configure web server in [iPic][].

### Upload all local images to cloud server

Typora provides a function to upload all local images to cloud server via [iPic][]. To use it, simply, check `Edit` → `Image Tools` → `Upload Local Images via iPic` from the menu bar and wait for the uploading process to complete.

### Upload when inserting images

How-tos for this part can be found in section [Inserting local images](#Inserting-local-images) → Upload image file to web server. (macOS only).

## Align images

Currently Typora does not support image alignment. But you could use HTML code like `<center>![img](src)</center>` to align images on exported HTML or PDF.

Also, by default, if one paragraph only contains one image, it will be center aligned. It is controlled by CSS, and can be reverted by [add custom CSS](http://support.typora.io/Add-Custom-CSS/):

```css
p .md-image:only-child{
    width: auto;
    text-align: inherit;
}
```
