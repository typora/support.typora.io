## New

### Github Style Alert

*Alerts* are an extension of *Markdown* used to emphasize critical information.

We now support Github's way to highlight "Note" and "Warning" using blockquote (<https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925>).

To use this, firstly, **please enable "Github Style Alert" in preferences panel:**

<img src="/media/new-1.8/Screenshot 2023-12-13 at 19.05.30.png" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-13 at 19.05.30" style="zoom:50%;" />

**An example of all five types:**

```gfm
> [!NOTE]  
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]  
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.
```

**Here is how they are displayed:**

<img src="/media/new-1.8/Screenshot 2023-12-13 at 19.02.02.png" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-13 at 19.02.02" style="zoom:50%;" />

Please note that this feature may not be supported in all Markdown specs.

And Github also does not provide any `i18n` solution for this. One current workaround is to [Add Custom CSS](/Add-Custom-CSS/). For example, to change the word "Note" to Chinese version "注意"：

```css
.md-alert-text-note .md-alert-text-container:after {
  content: "注意";
}
```

We will consider the improvement and provide other ways for this in future.

### Zoom with Mouse Wheel

> Please note that on macOS, we already support the native "Pinch to zoom" feature.

From version 1.8, we added zoom option in preferences panel.

Also, a new option is added, which enables zoom Typora with mouse wheel when `command` or `ctrl` key is pressed.

<img src="/media/new-1.8/Screenshot 2023-12-13 at 19.19.13.png" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-13 at 19.19.13" style="zoom:50%;" />

You can enable this when you are in class or making presentation, to quickly zoom in / out with mouse wheel and command / ctrl keys.

### MermaidJS with XY Chart

Our mermaid diagram now supports XY Chart, you can find more details here → <https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/xyChart.html>.

You can now draw charts like this:
