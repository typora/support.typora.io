## “Files” Section in Preferences Panel

In this version, we rearranged groups in Preferences Panel, and added a new group “Files” in Preferences Panel for files related configs.

Some new options are added:

1. Typora now allow user to set default file extensions when save file or add new file in files sidebar.
2. Typora now allow user to config actions when drop file or folders into Typora, currently it provides following two options: 
   - Open or import the file / folder in Typora
   - Insert a file link into Typora

## Options to Disable Auto Links

You can now config whether Typora should auto recognize and render links from `Preferences Panel` → `Markdown` → `Syntax Support`.

- When **Auto Links is disabled**, links like `https://typora.io` or `mailto:user@example.com` in the markdown document will NOT rendered as <ttps://typora.io> or <mailto:user@example.com>. 

  But you can use syntax like `[title](url)` or `<url>` to insert links.

- When **Auto Links is enabled**, links like `https://typora.io` or `mailto:user@example.com` in the markdown document will rendered as <ttps://typora.io> or <mailto:user@example.com> automatically.

##  Default Code Language

You can now set default code language for code blocks from `Preferences Panel` → `Code Fences`. And Typora provides some apply options:

- Apply default code language when add code fences from menubar, context menu, or from shortcut keys.
- Apply default code language when add code fences by input markdown syntax <code>```</code>. You can press **Backspace** key or **Undo** to delete auto applied code language.
- Apply in both cases.

| Auto Apply Code Language for Code Blocks inserted from menu  | Auto Apply Code Language for Code Blocks inserted from Markdown |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <video src="/media/new-1.6/menu.mp4" style="width: 100%;" muted="muted" loop></video> | <video src="/media/new-1.6/code.mp4" style="width: 100%;" muted="muted" loop></video> |

You can also choose **Last Used** to auto apply last used code language when insert new code blocks.
