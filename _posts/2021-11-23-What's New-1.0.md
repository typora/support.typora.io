## Changes from 0.11 (beta)

### New

#### New Builds

- Now ARM build for Windows / Linux is supported.

#### Math

After we upgrade to MathJax 3.x, there are some breaking changes from MathJax. 

Typora now provide two options to control the behavior:

- Added option to auto apply `displaylines` environment in math to support line break using \\.

  | auto apply `displaylines` env                                | disable auto apply `displaylines` env                        |

- Add option to allow physics package to redefined `\div` macro in math.

  Physics package is always enabled by Typora, but by default, Typora does not allow Physics package to redefine commands like `\div`, `\Re`. When enabled this option, Typora will take the definition of  `\div`, `\Re` in Physics package.

### Improvement / Fix

- Add welcome panel for new users.
- Reduce laggy when using IME.
- Add basic syntax highlight for `htaccess` and `js` syntax highlight now support some new features (like private field) from `ECMAScript 6`.
- Add warnings when user try to edit file from backup location. (Windows / Linux)
- Fix bug that new file in tile tree may result to duplicate files.
- Fix bug that Line break should be rendered as whitespace when ignore line break is enabled.
