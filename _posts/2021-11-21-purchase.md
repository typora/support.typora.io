## What is Typora's pricing plan?

It is one-time payment, not subscription.

A Typora license is granted to the "user", which can be activated on up to 3 devices from one person for one license with no expiration time.

You will have 15 days to evaluate Typora for free before purchasing a license code. If you're not satisfied with Typora for any reason, you will be able to get a full refund within 30 days from the license purchase.
